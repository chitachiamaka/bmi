    <h1>BMI</h1>
    <P>
        1. BMI Calculator Advanced (IF/ELSE)
        Previously, we've created a function that is able to calculate the BMI. But once we get a result, we will want
        to tell
        the user what the number means.

        Write a function that outputs (returns) a different message depending on the BMI.

        BMI <18.5, the output should be: "Your BMI is <bmi>, so you are underweight." BMI 18.5-24.9, the output should
            be "Your BMI is <bmi>, so you have a normal weight." BMI>24.9, the output should be "Your BMI is <bmi>, so
                you are
                overweight."

                The message MUST be returned as an output from your function. You should NOT NEED to use alert, prompt
                or
                console.log in this challenge.

                2. You’ve been asked by the local movie theater managers to implement some JavaScript for a new
                automated system
                they’re building. They want to be able to work out whether someone is allowed into a PG-13 movie or
                not.The
                rules are, if someone is 13 or over, they’re allowed in. If they’re not over 13, but they are
                accompanied by an
                adult, they’re also allowed in. Otherwise, they can’t see the movie.
                var age = 12;
                var accompanied = true;
                ???
                Finish this example using the age and accompanied variables to work out whether this 12-year-old is
                allowed to
                see the movie. Try changing the values (for example, set age to 13 and accompanied to false) and see if
                your
                code still works out the right answer.

                Thanks, Goodluck
